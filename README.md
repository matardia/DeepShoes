# DeepShoes
The end goal of this project is to classify retail pairs of sneakers and to also design new models of shoes using Deep Learning techniques such as Convolutional Neural Networks and Generative Adversarial Networks. 

The data used for training the model has been scraped and pre-processed using the python script <code>scrap_and_process.py</code>. The in <code>parameters.json</code> file contains its parameters.

The models are built from the <code>DeepShoes.ipynb</code> Notebook ran on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/matardia/deepshoes) with our scraped [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/matardia/nikeshoes) uploaded.

The <code>backup/</code> folder contains the final versions of the built models, uploaded on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/matardia/deepshoes-backup) as well. They are used in this Notebook <code>DeepShoes-usage.ipynb</code> that can be run [here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/matardia/deepshoes-usage) to generate shoes' images and predict their model.
